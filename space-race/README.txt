This is a recreation of the 1973 game Space Race, by Atari. The goal of the game is to navigate a spaceship
through a field of moving asteroids to the top of the screen. There are two ships, the left being controlled by the 
"W" and "S" keys and the right being controlled by the up and down arrows. Reaching the top of the screen scores a point and
respawns the ship at the bottom; hitting an asteroid respawns the ship at the bottom. The time left in the game is indicated by
the green bar. When the bar dissapears, the game ends, a short message is displayed and then the program quits.

This game runs on version 3.5.4 of Processing, an open-source low level animation and GUI library built on Java.
